BackVault is a high-performance optimization plugin designed for PaperMC servers that reduces lag without compromising gameplay. It intelligently manages server resources by optimizing entities, chunks, redstone, and more behind the scenes.

## ‚ú® Features

### Advanced Performance Optimizations
- **Smart Chunk Management**: Unloads inactive chunks based on player activity
- **Dynamic View Distance**: Automatically adjusts render distance based on server TPS
- **Entity AI Control**: Disables AI for mobs far from players
- **Redstone Optimization**: Throttles unnecessary redstone updates

### Resource Management
- **Item Stack Merging**: Combines nearby identical items to reduce entity count
- **Tile Entity Limits**: Prevents chunk overload from excessive tile entities
- **Hopper Optimization**: Reduces hopper checks in unloaded chunks

### Intelligent Systems
- **TPS-Based Adjustments**: Automatically scales optimizations based on server health
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Handles intensive tasks off the main thread
- **Configurable Limits**: Fine-tune every optimization parameter

## üì• Installation

  hopper-optimization: true    # Optimizes hopper item transfers
  merge-items: true            # Combines nearby identical items

entity-limits:
  per-chunk: 25                # Max entities per chunk
  mobs: 15                     # Max mobs per chunk
  items: 50                    # Max dropped items per chunk

view-distance:
  base: 6                      # Default view distance
  min: 4                       # Minimum when TPS is low
  max: 8                       # Maximum when TPS is high
```
